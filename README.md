# O Canada: For Arduino Uno R3 (single-line melody)

**O Canada**; encoded to play as a single-line melody on a passive buzzer using PWM on Arduino Uno R3.

### The YouTube Video of the Project
You can watch a video I made of this project at https://youtu.be/is9LnPHMvbw.

### Details
The **OCanada-ArduinoUnoR3-SingleChannel.ino** file is heavily commented.

I appreciate feedback.
Please let me know if I can make any improvements or if there are any errors in either my code or my interpretation of the notes.

This is what I submitted as my last lab assignment in the **Computer Organization II** course, which was part of my undergraduate computer science studies at **Ryerson University**. Following the sheet music, I encoded the single-line melody using the C constants of buzzer frequencies in a header file provided by the course instructor.

I used the Arduino Uno R3 board, made by Elegoo, one small breadboard, a passive buzzer, and two jumper cables from the kit (details below).

** I discovered these videos only after I wrote this project and its parallel project.
   As proof, you can see that great guys only encoded one single-line melody for one single passive buzzer on their Arduinos.
   However, I created a double-line melody for two passive buzzers as well as a parallel project that you can see below:
